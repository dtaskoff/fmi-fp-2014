The Exam
=============

Finally, we've come to the exam ^^.

As you should already know, there are four tasks:
* expression to tree, which must be written in scheme
* music sort and expression parser, which must be written in haskell
* and tic tac toe which can be written in whichever you want

Every task will be given 1.0 points with the exception
of expression parser which will give 1.5 points
(0.5 points for the evaluation part and 1.0 points for
the parser part).

The final grade
----------------
will be calculated by simply adding 2.0 to the received points,
so the grades will be from 2.0 to 6.5 :)

You will have 2.5 hours for all that.
--------------------------------

Important:
---------------
The tasks aren't sorted in any order of difficulty and the time is more than enough, so please take a look at all of them :).

Good luck and have fun!
